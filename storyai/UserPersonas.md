# Corporate Storytelling Evaluation Tool - User Personas & Pain Points

## Overview

This tool serves people in acute business crises - individuals who wake up at 3am in a panic because a critical business function is failing due to unclear storytelling.

## Persona 1: The CRO with the Champion Problem

### Profile
**Name:** David Chen  
**Title:** Chief Revenue Officer  
**Company:** 400-person enterprise infrastructure company  
**Industry:** B2B SaaS / Cloud Computing  

### The 3am Moment
"We lost the Citibank deal. Again. Same pattern - their VP of Infrastructure was ready to sign, went to his CFO for budget approval, and the CFO said 'I don't understand what makes you different from AWS.' We've lost $8M in deals this quarter because our champions can't sell us internally."

### Business Pain Metrics
- **Win rate:** 65% with technical buyers → 23% after executive review
- **Sales cycle:** 9 months (should be 6)
- **Lost pipeline:** $43M this year
- **Deal stall point:** CFO/CTO budget approval
- **Sales team frustration:** "We can't arm our champions"

### Trigger Moments
- Post-mortem meeting where CFO literally said "what do they do?"
- Sales VP reports: "Our champions love us but can't explain us"
- Board asks: "Why are we losing deals at the final stage?"
- Another $4M deal lost at executive review

### What He Needs to Learn
- ✓ Can a non-technical executive understand what we do from our materials?

**Title:** Chief Human Resources Officer  
**Company:** 400-person fintech company  
**Industry:** Financial Technology  

### The 3am Moment
"We just lost another finalist to Stripe. Third one this month. Our comp was competitive - actually 15% higher. But in the debrief, the candidate said 'I couldn't figure out what made your company special.' We're paying 30% above market to close people because they're not compelled by the mission - they're just negotiating."

### Business Pain Metrics
- **Offer acceptance rate:** 52% (should be 75%+)
- **Premium to close:** 28% above initial offer

**Title:** SVP of People & Culture  
**Company:** 1,200-person healthcare services company  
**Industry:** Healthcare IT / Services  

### The 3am Moment
"Engagement scores just came back. 43% of employees say their work isn't meaningful. But we do incredibly important work - we help hospitals reduce readmissions by 40%. Why can't our own people articulate that? When they go to parties and people ask what they do, they mumble something about 'healthcare IT.' They don't FEEL the importance."

### Business Pain Metrics
- **Engagement score:** 6.2/10 (down from 7.8 two years ago)
- **Voluntary turnover:** 23% (up from 14%)
- **Exit interviews:** "I didn't feel connected to the mission"

## Persona 4: The Rackspace Example (Specific Real-World Case)

### Profile
**Company:** Rackspace (or similar cloud infrastructure provider)  
**Persona:** VP of Sales or Chief Revenue Officer  

### The Specific Problem
"We're able to convince people who manage Cloud Compute that our offering is great. They get it. They're ready to buy. But when they go to their CFO or CTO to get budget approval, those executives can't understand why we're worth the money or what makes us different from AWS/Azure/GCP."

### The Two-Audience Gap
**Audience 1: Cloud Infrastructure Managers (Technical)**
- Understanding: ✅ High (82/100)
- They get the technical advantages
- They can see the differentiation
- They want to buy

**Audience 2: CFOs/CTOs (Budget Authority)**
- Understanding: ❌ Low (30/100)
- Lost in technical jargon
- Can't see business value
- Can't see differentiation
- Won't approve budget

### What the Report Shows
```
TECHNICAL LEVEL ASSESSMENT:
Your content technical level: 87/100 (highly technical)

├─ For Cloud Infrastructure Managers: ✅ 85/100 APPROPRIATE
└─ For CFOs/CTOs: 🚨 8/100 WAY TOO TECHNICAL

JARGON DENSITY: 89/100 🚨
Only 11% of your content is understandable without specialized knowledge.

EXAMPLES THAT LOSE CFOs:
"Multi-cloud orchestration with Kubernetes-native service mesh"
↳ Cloud manager: ✅ Understands this is valuable
↳ CFO: ❌ Has no idea what this means or why it saves money

"eBPF-based monitoring with custom OPA policies"
↳ Cloud manager: ✅ Knows this is technically superior
↳ CFO: ❌ Literally doesn't know what any of these words mean
```

### What This Persona Needs
- Quantified proof of the technical/business gap
- Specific examples of language that loses CFOs
- Business-value translations of technical features
- Competitor comparison (who's doing this better?)

## Cross-Persona Patterns

### Common Thread: The "Champion Can't Sell You Internally" Problem

All three personas face versions of the same issue:
- **CRO:** Technical champion can't convince CFO
- **CHRO:** Employee can't convince friend to join
- **People Leader:** Employee can't explain value to family/friends

### The Core Insight
Your story works for ONE audience (the technical expert, the insider) but fails for ANOTHER audience (the decision-maker, the outsider, the non-expert).

### What They All Need
1. **Quantified evidence** of the problem (scores)
2. **Specific examples** of what's failing (citations)
3. **Audience-specific assessment** (not one-size-fits-all)
4. **Business impact** (what this is costing them)
5. **Proof this is complex** (so they need expert help)

## User Journey: From Crisis to Call

### Stage 1: Crisis Recognition (Before They Find Us)
- Something specific goes wrong (lost deal, lost candidate, engagement drop)
- They suspect messaging is part of the problem
- They're looking for validation or evidence

### Stage 2: Discovery
- Find Feedforward through Adam's content
- See the evaluation tool
- Think: "This could give me the evidence I need"

### Stage 3: Submission (30 seconds)
- Quick form: URL + email
- Optional: files, specific audience
- Low barrier: No account, no commitment
- Expectation: "I'll get something useful in 10 minutes"

### Stage 4: The Wait (5-10 minutes)
- Confirmation email: "We're analyzing..."
- Anxiety: "What if it's too generic?"
- Hope: "What if this nails the problem?"

### Stage 5: Report Arrival
**First 30 seconds (Executive Summary):**
- See their specific business problem named
- See quantified scores
- Think: "Holy shit, they got it" or "This is wrong"

**Next 5 minutes (Skimming):**
- Look for: Real citations from their content?
- Look for: Specific to them or generic?
- Feel: Defensive but also validated

**Next 10-15 minutes (Deep Read):**
- Read detailed findings
- See competitor comparison
- Realize: "This is more complex than I thought"
- Think: "I can't fix this myself"

### Stage 6: Decision Point
**If the report is good:**
- Forward to colleagues ("See? This is what I've been saying")
- Forward to CEO ("This explains why we're losing deals")
- Book call with Feedforward

**If the report misses:**
- Dismiss it
- Don't share
- Lost opportunity

### Critical Success Factors
The report must:
1. **Name their specific crisis** (not generic)
2. **Show evidence** (real citations, not made up)
3. **Quantify the problem** (scores that are shocking)
4. **Prove complexity** (thorough enough to be intimidating)
5. **Offer hope** (this is fixable with expert help)

## Jobs to Be Done

When someone uses this tool, they're hiring it to:

### Primary Jobs
1. **Validate a suspicion** ("I think our messaging is broken")
2. **Build a case** ("I need evidence to convince leadership")
3. **Understand the problem** ("I know something's wrong but can't articulate what")
4. **Find the solution** ("Who can help me fix this?")

### Secondary Jobs
1. **Benchmark against competitors** ("Are we worse than others?")
2. **Measure progress** ("Did our rebrand help?")
3. **Educate their team** ("Here's what good storytelling looks like")

### The Job They're NOT Hiring It For
- Learn how to fix it themselves (they want to hire you, not DIY)
- Get generic best practices (they want specific assessment)
- Save money (they're willing to pay for expertise)

## Next Steps

Once these personas are validated:
1. Build calibration workflow for Adam
2. Create test set of companies (10-20 per industry)
3. Design report structure that serves these specific crises
4. Test with real prospects in each persona category
