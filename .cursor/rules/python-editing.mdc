# Python File Editing Rule - CRITICAL

## MANDATORY WORKFLOW

**When editing ANY Python file, you MUST:**

1. **Edit the file**
2. **IMMEDIATELY run:** `black <file_path>`
3. **Verify:** `black --check <file_path>` passes
4. **THEN commit**

## Why This Rule Exists

We've had 20+ commits fixing Black formatting issues. The root cause:
- Code edited manually
- Black not run before commit
- CI fails
- Fix applied
- Cycle repeats

## Enforcement

**This rule is MANDATORY. No exceptions.**

If you edit a Python file and don't run Black:
- The commit will fail CI
- You'll have to fix it
- This wastes time

## Example Workflow

```bash
# Edit file
vim src/agents/synthesis_agent.py

# IMMEDIATELY run Black
black src/agents/synthesis_agent.py

# Verify
black --check src/agents/synthesis_agent.py

# Then commit
git add src/agents/synthesis_agent.py
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
```

## Alternative: Use Black Format on Save

If your editor supports it, configure Black to format on save. This prevents the issue entirely.

## Remember

**NEVER commit Python code without running Black first.**

This is not optional. This is mandatory.
