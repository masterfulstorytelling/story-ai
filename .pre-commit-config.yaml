# Pre-commit hooks to run before each commit
# 
# INSTALLATION (REQUIRED - Run this once per repository clone):
#   cd ai-processing
#   python3 -m venv venv  # if venv doesn't exist
#   source venv/bin/activate
#   pip install pre-commit
#   pre-commit install
#
# This will automatically format code with Black and check with flake8
# before every commit. Commits will be blocked if formatting fails.
#
# To run manually: pre-commit run --all-files

repos:
  # Black removed - it was causing too many issues without clear value
  # If you want formatting, use your IDE's auto-formatter instead

    hooks:
      - id: flake8
        name: flake8 (Python linter - E501 ignored)
        files: ^ai-processing/
        args: [--max-line-length=100, --extend-ignore=E203,E501,W503]
        # E501 ignored because Black handles line length
